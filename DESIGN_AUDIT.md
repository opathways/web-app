# Design System Audit Report

## Current State Analysis

### Color Palette Issues
- **Current Tailwind Config**: Uses `#10A37F` for primary color
- **Design System Spec**: Should use `#19C37D` for primary accent
- **Gray Scale**: Current grays don't match the specified design system values

### Component Alignment Issues

#### 1. Card Component (`components/Card.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses white background and rounded corners
- ❌ Shadow doesn't match design system specifications
- ❌ Padding could be more consistent with design system

#### 2. SidebarNav Component (`components/SidebarNav.tsx`)
- ❌ Uses generic Tailwind grays instead of design system colors
- ❌ Active state styling doesn't match design system
- ❌ Typography doesn't follow design system specifications

#### 3. FormSection Component (`components/FormSection.tsx`)
- ❌ Uses Amplify UI components with inconsistent styling
- ❌ Typography and spacing don't align with design system

#### 4. Dashboard Page (`app/(employer)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- ❌ Mixes Amplify UI components with custom Tailwind classes
- ❌ Color usage inconsistent with design system
- ❌ Typography and spacing need alignment
- ❌ Card layouts could better follow design system grid

#### 5. Company Profile Page (`app/(employer)/company-profile/page.tsx`)
- ❌ Basic placeholder implementation
- ❌ Needs complete redesign to match design system
