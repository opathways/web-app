## Route Details

| Route Path | Access Level | Purpose |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| `/login` | PUBLIC | Login page using Amplify Auth UI. |
| `/dashboard` | EMPLOYER-only | Main dashboard after login; shows overview and nav. |
| `/company-profile/new` | EMPLOYER-only | Create company profile (if one doesn't exist). |
| `/company-profile` | EMPLOYER-only | View company profile details. |
| `/company-profile/edit` | EMPLOYER-only | Edit existing company profile. |
| `/jobs` | EMPLOYER-only | List all job postings by the employer. |
| `/jobs/new` | EMPLOYER-only | Create a new job listing. |
| `/jobs/[id]` | EMPLOYER-only | View details for a specific job. |
| `/jobs/[id]/edit` | EMPLOYER-only | Edit a specific job listing. |
| `/jobs/[id]/applicants` | EMPLOYER-only | View all applicants for a job. |
| `/jobs/[id]/applicants/[applicantId]` | EMPLOYER-only | View and update applicant status. |

## Access Control Notes

- All routes except `/login` require EMPLOYER authentication via AWS Amplify Auth
- Dynamic routes use Next.js bracket notation: `[id]`, `[applicantId]`
- Company profile creation (`/new`) is only shown if no profile exists
- Job and applicant management follows standard CRUD patterns
- Authentication is handled by AWS Cognito with EMPLOYER group membership
